# Hydro Gen 2040: Mapping Uncertainties and the Future of Green Hydrogen in Saudi Arabia

## Project Overview

This project, **Hydro Gen 2040**, focuses on analyzing and mapping the uncertainties around green hydrogen production in Saudi Arabia. Through scenario planning and strategic analysis, the project aims to provide insights into how Saudi Arabia can capitalize on green hydrogen by 2040. The notebook utilizes various frameworks, models, and data analysis tools to predict future trends in the hydrogen energy market.

## Key Features

- **Energy Market Analysis**: Examines various hydrogen types (grey, blue, and green), focusing on green hydrogen's potential in the Saudi energy market.
- **PESTELL and SWOT Analysis**: A thorough analysis of factors affecting the future of green hydrogen in Saudi Arabia.
- **Scenario Development (2x2 Matrix)**: The project employs a 2x2 matrix approach to visualize possible future scenarios for green hydrogen development in the region.
- **Strategic Models**: Uses Porter’s Advanced Forces to analyze market competition and Sentiment Analysis to gauge public perception of the project.
- **Visualization & Data Analysis**: The project makes use of Python’s data analysis libraries (like pandas, scikit-learn) to run simulations, create visualizations, and model future outcomes.

## Notebooks

- **CSCI.ipynb**: Contains the core analysis, including the PESTELL, SWOT, and Porter’s Forces analyses. It also covers sentiment analysis, data processing, and scenario mapping. Also covering with deeper dives into data preparation, visualization, and strategic scenario development using machine learning models.
- **SentimentAanalysis_CSCI.ipynb**: It covers sentiment analysis, data processing, and scenario mapping.
